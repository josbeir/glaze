# Core extensions

Glaze ships with built-in extensions that are **opt-in** — they do nothing unless explicitly enabled in `glaze.neon`. This keeps every project lean: no sitemap, no extra files, unless you ask for them.

## Enabling core extensions

Add an `extensions` key to `glaze.neon` with the names of the extensions you want:

```neon
extensions:
    - sitemap
    - llms-txt
```

Each entry matches the `name` declared in the extension's `#[GlazeExtension]` attribute.

You can mix core names, project extension names (from your `extensions/` directory), and fully-qualified class names in the same list:

```neon
extensions:
    - sitemap
    - my-project-hook
    - App\Extensions\AnalyticsExtension
```

### Passing options

Extensions that implement `ConfigurableExtension` accept per-extension options. Switch from list to map syntax for any extension that needs them:

```neon
extensions:
    - llms-txt
    my-extension:
        apiKey: abc123
        endpoint: https://example.com/hook
```

List and map entries can be mixed freely.

## Available extensions

### `sitemap`

Generates a `sitemap.xml` file in the output directory after each successful build.

The sitemap is built from all written pages. Last-modified dates are resolved from frontmatter keys (`lastmod`, `lastModified`, `updatedAt`, `date`), falling back to the source file's modification time.

```neon
extensions:
    - sitemap
```

The sitemap URL is constructed from `site.baseUrl` and `site.basePath` in `glaze.neon`. Configure your site metadata for correct absolute URLs:

```neon
site:
    baseUrl: https://example.com
    basePath: /docs
```

#### Options

Switch to map syntax to pass options:

```neon
extensions:
    sitemap:
        changefreq: weekly
        priority: 0.8
        exclude:
            - /drafts
```

| Option | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `changefreq` | string | `<changefreq>` value added to every URL entry. One of: `always`, `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly`, `never`. |
| `priority` | float | `<priority>` value added to every URL entry. Clamped to the range `0.0`–`1.0`. |
| `exclude` | list&lt;string&gt; | URL path prefixes whose pages are omitted from the sitemap. |

---

### `llms-txt`

Generates an `llms.txt` file in the output directory — a lightweight machine-readable index intended for LLM ingestion workflows.

The file lists all built pages with their title, description, and canonical URL, following the [llms.txt convention](https://llmstxt.org/).

```neon
extensions:
    - llms-txt
```

Page descriptions are resolved from the `description` frontmatter field, falling back to the first paragraph of the page body.

#### Options

Switch to map syntax to pass options:

```neon
extensions:
    llms-txt:
        title: My Project
        pitch: A static site generator for PHP developers.
        context: Browse the links below for complete documentation.
        exclude:
            - /drafts
```

| Option | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | string | Overrides the `# heading` line. Falls back to `site.title`. |
| `pitch` | string | Overrides the `> quote` line. Falls back to the auto-resolved project pitch. |
| `context` | string | Overrides the context paragraph below the quote. |
| `exclude` | list&lt;string&gt; | URL path prefixes whose pages are omitted from the listing. |

## Writing your own named extension

Any extension class in your `extensions/` directory with a `name` in its `#[GlazeExtension]` attribute can be opted into from `glaze.neon` the same way:

```php
// extensions/Analytics.php
#[GlazeExtension('analytics')]
final class Analytics
{
    #[ListensTo(BuildEvent::BuildCompleted)]
    public function run(BuildCompletedEvent $event): void { ... }
}
```

```neon
extensions:
    - analytics
```
